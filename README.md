# Predicting the Football EURO 2020
This repo contains a Jupyter Notebook file that describes my approach of predicting the Football EURO 2020. While there was not much time to set up the model before the opening game of the tournament, I still was able to finish in 3rd place (out of 34) thanks to the model. 
Feel free to add suggestions for improvement as this project will be revised for the next tournament.
